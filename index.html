      <h2>The Unexpected Sounds of the Apartments</h2>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>Foncim Apartments, designed by Leonard, Veysseyre & Kruze in the early 20th century, was initially intended for the urban middle class. Over decades of adaptation, it has accumulated layers of fluidity in both time and space, evolving into a mosaic of living typologies. This includes Shanghai’s iconic "72 Tenants" phenomenon: compressed personal spaces, sounds breaching boundaries, and porous thresholds between public and private realms. Here, sound becomes the ultimate medium of fluidity.</p>
        <p>Yet unlike many contemporaneous buildings reshaped by gentrification, Foncim Apartments thrives in grassroots vitality, generating sustained influence through social media. Its chaos and complexity—fragile, porous boundaries—reflect both its uniqueness and universality. An ideal city cannot homogenize its voices; learning to coexist with multiplicity is a collective imperative.</p>
        <p>In an era of accelerating homogenization, we hope this work guides viewers beyond sanitized urban facades into complex, uncertain interstitial spaces—sparking reflection on urban renewal and the pursuit of ideal living.</p>
        <p>Your voice will be transformed into the memory of the building.</p>
